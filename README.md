🃏 Blackjack Simulation in Python

🎯 Overview

This project is a Python-based simulation of the classic Blackjack card game. The goal is simple: reach a total of 21 (or as close as possible without going over) before the computer does. Test your luck and strategy in this exciting digital version of Blackjack!

📚 Learning Experience

I created this project as part of my journey to learn and improve my Python programming skills. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

Control flow (loops, conditionals, and game logic)
Functions and modular programming
Randomization and handling shuffled card decks
User input and decision-making in a game environment
This project helped me better understand game logic implementation, and I plan to enhance it further with additional features in the future! 🚀

🏆 How to Play

The game starts by dealing two shuffled cards to both the player and the computer.
You can choose to:
Hit: Draw another card.
Stand: Keep your current total and let the computer play.
The computer will automatically play based on predefined rules.
The winner is determined by whoever is closest to 21 without exceeding it.
📜 Rules

Aces can be 1 or 11, depending on the best possible hand.
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points.
The dealer must hit on 16 or lower and stand on 17 or higher.
If you exceed 21, you bust and lose the round.
If both you and the dealer have the same total, it's a push (tie).
